# DMA-Challenge---2016

Here I am submitting my solution to this year's DMA challenge officially sponsored by Ernst & Young.

The approach to the solution is ensembling of logistic model, linear model and single decision tree model. The predictions of all these models were fetched as an input to xgboost model which is used as final solution. 

I could not make to the top list with this approach and so would like other's opinions/suggestions to further improve it.
